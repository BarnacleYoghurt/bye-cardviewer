The BYE Cardviewer Wordpress plugin is meant to provide an easier and prettier way of displaying the custom cards of the Bionicle YGOPro Expansion on the [official website](https://bye-project.xyz). It supports displaying cards from different expansion packs, versions, and languages.

Folder structure:
* `/src/`: JavaScript and (S)CSS files of the plugin's custom blocks. Compiled into `/build/` (not tracked).
* `/block-meta`: The `block.json` file for each custom block.
* `/classes/`: PHP classes of the plugin.
